In the beginning of my project i initially was interested in circular motion which is what led me to the sin and cos functions in p5js as explained in the document submitted in the zip file, however interactivity remained to be a element i wanted to include heavily in my project as any code could put out a different result eveytime i wanted each run of the code to be personal to each user as they would have edited changed the piece to fit what they think looks best. I included a number of sliders in my piece in order to achieve this. Each slider changes a different variable in the code, there is one slider that changes the alpha levels in the color of the lines, another slider changes the framerate of the code which is a function specific to p5js and from the users' perspective either speeds up or slows down the speed of the lines on the page. The third slider on my piece is for the sharpness of the turn of the lines, it works by multiplying the sin and cos values of the lines by the value of the slider. Each slider is labelled on the webpage, the webpage also informs the user that the sliders will change what is happening on screen however it is not explained in depth as i wanted the user to experiment with the functions themselves with only minimal instruction.
