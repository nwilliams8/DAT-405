I began the development on my project by looking for a movie api that uses a json format which led me to the open movie database, once i received my api key i made an array of all the films that i wanted to be shown in my project and then proceeded to make a loop that loaded the api for each film in the array. After all the links had been loaded i could choose properties of the film that i wanted to display such as box office earnings, production company and the actors featured. Because i wanted to have buttons that revealed more information about the film i decided to only 3 details being included on the initial page with a checkbox that toggled an optional 4th detail, i did this because if i displayed too many details on the initial page then there would be no need for the user to investigate the project further. I put a box on the left hand side of each set of details, the size of which is relative to the box office earnings of the film, the boxes are labelled "details" along with a line on the bottom of the page which explains to the user what the purpose of the box is. Once the box is clicked all the other data on the page is cleared and new details are presented including the poster of the film, actors, writers, imdb rating and runtime. I then decided to make a button that would return the user to the initial page of my project, the button has a function attached to it that resets the program, i did this because it overwrites the current data that is on the screen. Another feature i added towards the end of my development process was the colour of the text and boxes in my project. The colour is decided by an if statement that takes the box office earnings of the film and then assigns the colour based off of this. The less the film earned the brighter the colour will be for example, the film "The Incredible Hulk" earned $134 million in the box office and because of this the box and text is a light salmon colour whilst "The Avengers" earned $623 million meaning the box and text are a dark red colour. The title of the film changes position when the user clicks on the details along with the details box. The title is moved to the bottom right along with a change to the font and size, i did this because it give the page a better layout and adds to the style of the project. The details, poster and box are all moved more towards the left side of the page, there is also a label underneath the box showing the amount that the movie made in the box office. Because i only wanted the checkbox to work on the initial page of my project i added in a boolean variable that is changed to true whenever the user clicks on a box and then changes back to false when the back button is pressed, an if statement was also added to the checkbox function that only allowed it to be used if the variable is false.
